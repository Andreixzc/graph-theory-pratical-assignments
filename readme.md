# Assigments overview:
## TP01:
The assignment involves identifying blocks in graphs, particularly focusing on 2-connected (biconnected) graphs. Students are required to implement three methods for identifying these blocks in graphs, including checking for internally disjoint paths, identifying articulation points, and utilizing Tarjan's method. The assignment also includes conducting experiments to evaluate these methods' performance on graphs with varying numbers of vertices.

## TP02:
This assignment involves solving the k-center problem, which can be interpreted as a facility location task in various scenarios. In this context, points (or vertices) represent locations that need to be supplied by a specific type of facility, with distances defined as the shortest cost route between points, considering factors such as spatial distance, time, or a combination of factors. The goal is to establish these facilities at up to k points to minimize the maximum transportation time between a common point and its nearest treatment center, ensuring efficient patient transfers. Each group must implement and compare two distinct methods for solving this problem: one exact (for small instances) and one approximate (for larger instances). The implementations must be tested with 40 instances from the OR-Library for the p-median problem, which is similar to the k-center problem. The provided dataset includes instance size (number of vertices), the maximum number of centers (k), and the optimal solution radius.
